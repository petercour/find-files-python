## Find file

Python program that searches for file on the computer.
You must specify the filename and path. If you want a general
search you can search like

    result = find('*.zip', '/home/linux/Downloads/')

for specific file

    result = find('hello.txt', '/home/linux/Downloads/')

It returns a list, even for a single search result.
